AdBlock rules for blocking the fucking ads added by Liaoning Unicom


***


Several days ago, I changed my broadband operator to Liaoning Unicom, for better overseas bandwidth. After that, a lot of ads came to me. I called 10010, 10015, and complained to MIIT, no one could solve this issue for me.

I had to block these fucking ads, by setting up Koolproxy on my router and loading this rule file.
